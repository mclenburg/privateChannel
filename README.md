Tired of always watching that lame TV uniform pap?
This project will develop server software that connects to streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ or amazon prime.
The software scans the offered movies and series of the different providers and generates a random playlist, which is provided as m3u8 stream.
In addition, the playlist is created for a configurable number of days in advance and provided in XMLTV format via EPG file.

Your own station for you at home.
